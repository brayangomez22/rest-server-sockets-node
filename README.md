# Socket Server

- The first thing we must do after downloading the code is to execute the command:

```
npm install
```

That command will download all the node modules needed to run the project.

- Generate the dist folder

```
tsc -w
```

- When finished installing the node_modules, then we can run the server with the following command

```
nodemon dist/
```
